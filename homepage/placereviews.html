                <p class="card-text"> My relatives own this place, so I usually get a discount when buying from this place. I have gone here countless times and they have restaurants in Bellrose, Jamaica, Long Island, and Jackson Heights. I like the lollipop chicken, hot and sour soup, shrimp fried rice, dry beef, sagar chicken, and many more dishes . Always pack with people, and service is very responsive. Overall good mixture of Chinese and Indian cuisine.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This place is like walking back into a supermarket in India, except the currency is dollars. They seem to have everything though - Indian sweets and treats, meat, masala, herbs and spices, utensils and the list goes on. My parents always shop here for the different spices and the frozen samosas. This place is massive.  Rows upon rows of spices and nuts / produce that doesn't look like it fell off the back of the truck / a huge freezer section of microwavable curries and noodle dishes. I just don’t like how the place is always crowded and some of the cashiers are especially so rude.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Not a dine in restaurant. Kababish restaurant offers some of the tastiest kebabs in New York at the greatest prices. With an extensive menu of Indian and Pakistani food, there's an affordable, delicious Middle East or Southeast Asian option for everyone. From chicken gyros to spicy staples, this restaurant has it all. The kebabs come with lettuce, onion, and jalapenos. They also gave me three containers of their yogurt sauce, which ended up being the perfect amount. And they packaged everything really nicely, each component of the meal was wrapped tight in it's own foil ensuring the food made it safely home.</p>

                <p class="card-text">There's a great selection of fabrics and patterns, though the prices might cause sticker shock compared to what you'd get in India. You can find a variety worth of clothes here ranging from all different colors and sizes. They even have a person to fix the clothes to adjust the sizes. The staff, however, is very rude and yelling at a customer under most circumstances is uncalled for and unacceptable. They yell at the kids for eating ice cream in the shop and I had to wait outside all by myself because they would not allow me to stand in the corner to finish my food.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="card-text">This is one of the few places that has a dinner buffet in addition to the lunch buffet. They just slide into dinner from lunch. They have some salads, mutton, chicken, couple of different varieties of rice, naan, three or four veg dishes, chaat and desserts. It doesn’t seem like a large spread from the outside but it is a good place and the food tastes good. They have a full bar which is nice. Nice place to have a quiet dinner and drinks. Once in s while you get a bus load of tourists come in at the same time but usually not too crowded.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I usually buy all my gold jewelry from here because one of the workers gives us a reasonable price everytime we go. They have a variety of gold jewlery randing from rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, etc. The people who work there are pretty friendly for the most part. Some seem like they are in a pissed off mood, but they usually show you all the items you want to see. The prices always range depending on what time of the year it is. Sometimes you can buy an item for $120 in March, but in June the prices spark up to $160 for the same pair of earrings.</p>

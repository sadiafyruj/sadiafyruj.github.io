                  </div>
                  <p class="card-text">3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama. The film follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under an Indian education system. The film is narrated through parallel dramas, one in the present and the other ten years in the past. Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. Some of the scenes are really emotional. This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies.</p>

This movie is a story of the exhilarating and terrifying journey of four characters as they navigate through their youth; from their carefree laughter as they set off on a holiday together in their college days, until their bittersweet tears as they watch the first of their friends get married. Naina Talwar (protagonist) makes an impulsive decision to go on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up to Manali. Before Naina can express herself, Kabir leaves India to pursue his career. They meet again years later, but he still cherishes his dreams more than bonds.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Dear Zindagi is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age drama film. Kaira, a young girl, faces problems in her relationships. Things get complicated and Kaira has to deal with the low phase in his personal and professional life. She moves back to her parents in Goa for a short time. Out there she meets a physiatrist Jehangir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and starts following his therapies so that she can lead a normal and peaceful life. He helps her resolve her issues with her parents and get a new perspective on life, which leads to her following her passion and an improvement in her love life. Not only does the movie aim to break through the taboo that surrounds mental illness but it also gives out major life lessons: let it go, parents can make mistakes, the harder path might not always be the right one, it is okay not to be okay, and asking for help does not make you weak. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge also known by DDLJ, is a 1995 Indian Hindi-language romance film. The story of the film set in 90s revolves around two strangers who happen to bump into each other during a Europe trip. Raj and Simran, the two immortal characters have a hate-hate relationship which later turns into undying love. However, Simran’s father has vowed to get his girl married to his friend’s son and so the family leaves for India. This is the time when the love dawns upon the two estranged friends and Raj sets out to win back his love. “DDLJ" has such widespread popularity because it manages to convey two entirely opposing messages. It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will.</p>
